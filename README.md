Those forecasting models was part of my thesis, with name "FORECASTING EXCHANGE RATES BY USING COMMODITY
PRICES WITH TRADITIONAL ECONOMETRIC, MACHINE LEARNING AND DEEP LEARNING TECHNIQUES", at City University of London.

Abstract :

The accuracy of the prediction of economic parameters and the correct estimation of foreign
exchange rates are of paramount importance in modern global economy. For this reason, the
use of computational techniques, which are based on technology, in order to forecast
macroeconomic variables is essential and highly recommended. This project intends to make a
multistep forecast by using multivariate times series in order to predict the exchange rates of
the Australian dollar while using the most tradeable exports of Australia. To do so, the Vector
Auto Regression model, the Support Vector Machine model and the Recurrent Neural
Networks with Long Short-Term Memory model have been used. Also, monthly historical data
for five macroeconomic variables have been used for the period between August 1995 and
January 2020 to predict the Australian Foreign Exchange Rate.
